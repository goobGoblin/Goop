\section{Introduction}

Goop is an application that allows users to view, save, share, and find songs, albums, DJ Mixes, and artists. Its primary feature is its fine-tuned searching and cataloging of music based on any user-given parameters. The database allows users to see specific information about music such as release date, record label, performing artists, DJ mixes, and more. For example, if a user wants to display every DJ mix that contains a specific song or artistâ€“or if they want to see a record label's discography from a specified timeframe. 

Each user account with their profiles and account information are stored in the database. Additionally, users are able to save and organize their music. Users are allowed to follow each other in addition to artists, labels, genres. This service is primarily useful for DJs/performers who are "crate digging" or finding new music to play in their mixes. Being able to fine-tune search results based on adjacent information (such as which mixes a song was played in or the labels an artist is on) in a collection will assist in organizing record libraries in external applications like Rekordbox, Serato, or VirtualDJ. 

The concept for Goop was born from frustrations we have had with the existing options for music cataloging. There are lots of options but all of them have significant drawbacks, the biggest of which is that they all have a narrow scope, designed to focus on one specific aspect of music cataloging and categorization, the other issue that is ubiquitous with these sites is a severely outdated, often hard to navigate UI. Rate Your Music and Album of the Year exist for rating, reviewing, and cataloging tracks and albums but neither of them provide tracklists for DJ mixes and while Rate Your Music has more data, depth, and flexibility the UI is far worse than the simpler but cleaner Album of the Year site. For getting tracklists of DJ mixes there are a few options such as 1001Tracklists, TracklistsDB and Tracklists.net all provide similar functionality but their interfaces are outdated and the integration of the tracklists with other information such as the album tracks are from, their release dates, their associated record labels, the genre of the individual tracks etc. For finding events in your area and finding electronic music recommendations Resident Advisor is fantastic however it is limited mostly to electronic music and the mixes posted on the site do not have tracklists. All of this makes for a frustrating and tedious experience for those that want to dig for music using one platform with a database that connects Albums, Genres, Mixes, Labels, Artists, Events and more. 

The biggest challenge for creating an application like this is populating the database. A lot of the aforementioned sites rely on community contribution and/or integrate with streaming services such as spotify to ensure new music is added to the database. Seeing as implementing solutions like this would not be feasible for our timeline we relied on scraping data from some of these existing sites to test our database schema and user interface. If we were to continue with this project we would enable to user contributions and could potentially integrate with streaming services to constantly update the database with newly released music.

In this report we will detail what we cover what our app is capable of currently, our methodology including how we constructed our database and schema as well as how we built the UI. We will also cover plans to expand the functionality in the future.

\section{Requirements Analysis}

\subsection{Constraints}

\subsubsection{Entity-Relationship Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Each user must have a unique username.
    \item Each artist, genre, and label should have a unique identifier.
    \item Albums, tracks, and DJ mixes should be uniquely identified.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Referential Integrity Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensure that foreign key constraints are in place to maintain referential integrity. For example, an album should belong to a specific artist, genre, and label.
    \item Tracks within an album should be linked to the respective album they belong to.
    \item Users can only follow existing entities in the database (users, artists, labels, and genres).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Integrity Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement constraints to enforce data integrity, such as NOT NULL constraints for mandatory fields.
    \item Define constraints to ensure that publication dates are valid and reasonable.
    \item Implement check constraints to validate data against specific criteria, such as ensuring publication dates are not in the future.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Performance Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider indexing columns frequently used in search operations to improve query performance.
    \item Optimize database schema and queries to minimize response times, especially for operations involving large datasets.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Consistency Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensure consistency across related entities. For example, if an artist's name is updated, it should reflect consistently across albums, tracks, and DJ mixes associated with that artist.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operations}

\subsubsection{Create Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add new users, artists, genres, labels, albums, tracks, and DJ mixes.
    \item Establish relationships between entities (e.g., users following artists, labels, or other users).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Read Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Retrieve information about users, artists, genres, labels, albums, tracks, and DJ mixes.
    \item Fetch lists of albums, tracks, and DJ mixes belonging to specific artists, genres, or labels.
    \item Retrieve the followers/following lists of users and entities they follow.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Update Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Modify user profiles, artist information, genre details, label information, album details, track details, and DJ mix details.
    \item Update relationships, such as users following/unfollowing other users, artists, genres, or labels.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Delete Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Remove users, artists, genres, labels, albums, tracks, and DJ mixes from the database.
    \item Delete relationships between entities, such as users unfollowing artists, genres, or labels.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Search Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Search for users, artists, genres, labels, albums, tracks, and DJ mixes based on various criteria (e.g., name, genre, publication date).
    \item Perform advanced searches, such as finding tracks by artist or album name, or finding users with similar tastes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Aggregate Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Calculate statistics, such as the number of users following a particular artist, label, or genre.
    \item Aggregate data, such as counting the total number of albums, tracks, or DJ mixes in the database.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Transactional Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Execute transactions to maintain data consistency and integrity (e.g., updating multiple entities atomically).
    \item Ensure that operations such as following/unfollowing entities are performed reliably and consistently.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reporting Operations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generate reports on user activity, popular artists/genres/labels, trending albums, tracks, or DJ mixes.
    \item Provide insights into user preferences and behavior based on their interactions with the platform.
\end{itemize}
